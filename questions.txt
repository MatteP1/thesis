- sequential and concurrent spec rely on same definitions/lemmas (e.g. isLL). But if I separate them out into "common", then the Sigma becomes different. How to deal with this?

- Should I include all the small definitions like is_first, is_snd_last in the report?

- Formatting: format points to fraction? format persistent points to?

- In the proof outlines, should I refer to the rules I am using (wp-X, ht-Y, Inv-Alloc, etc)?
  Should I present it in the style of hoare triples, manipulating pre and post conditions?
  Or in the style of weakest precondition, matching the mechanised proofs?

- Should I use I or We in the report? 
  For instance: I open the invariant/We open the invariant.
  If I refer to something "I" in particular did, should I just refer to myself as I? E.g. I didn't realise this possibility in my first attempt.

- What is the notation for agreement?

- In the modular counter spec, is it really necessary to have the Cnt predicate in the post-condition? It is persistent after all...

- Why is the client not allowed to open the invariant associated with the Cnt/is_queue predicate?

- In HeapLang, comparisons (including those in CmpXchg) can only be done between values where at least one of the values is val_compare_safe.
  In particular, in lockfree ms queue, the cas compares pairs, which are not val_compare_safe.
  Not a problem if ignore ABA, as then the ms queue simplifies to compare pointers.

- In the two-lock version, the Head and Tail pointer initially point to the same location. How to model this in Heaplang and Iris?

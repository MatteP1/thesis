- wp_cmpxchg_fail can't find persistent points-to predicates. What to do?
	Make it find it explicitly in the persistent context until bug has been fixed.

- It is paramount that tail doesn't lag behind head in lock-free variant (because of dequeue).
  In refinement paper, they achieve this using abstract reachability.
  I will have to do something similar...
  Any thoughts?

- In lemmas, should I write "For all nodes x, we have that x = x". Or should I just write "x = x".
  I.e. style of Abs-reach-Concr vs style of reach-transitive

- Hocap-style specification vs 
  HOCAP-style specification vs
  HOCAP specification?

  Includes locallabel.sty, pftools.sty, and "Inferences Rules" section in thesis.tex preamble.

- What is usually put in Acknowledgments?

- Should I have also have Abstract in danish (resum√©)? It was part of template.

  If not, where to cut?

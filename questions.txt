- sequential and concurrent spec rely on same definitions/lemmas (e.g. isLL). But if I separate them out into "common", then the Sigma becomes different. How to deal with this?

- What's next? Hocap? Lock-free?
  Hocap. Prepare some stuff for Wednesday

- For Hocap, would the concrete state be isLL xs, and the abstract state simply be xs?
  (See bottom of page 121 in https://iris-project.org/tutorial-pdfs/iris-lecture-notes.pdf)
  This would also seem a bit weird as the abstract state would then contain locations, which is implementation specific.

  Let the abstract state xs_v be a list of values. Then existentially quantify a list xs containing (loc * val * loc), whose value projection is xs_v: proj_val xs = xs_v

- Should I include all the small definitions like is_first, is_snd_last in the report?

- Formatting: format points to fraction? format persistent points to?

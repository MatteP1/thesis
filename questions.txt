- sequential and concurrent spec rely on same definitions/lemmas (e.g. isLL). But if I separate them out into "common", then the Sigma becomes different. How to deal with this?

- What's next? Hocap? Lock-free?
  Hocap. Prepare some stuff for Wednesday

- For Hocap, would the concrete state be isLL xs, and the abstract state simply be xs?
  (See bottom of page 121 in https://iris-project.org/tutorial-pdfs/iris-lecture-notes.pdf)
  This would also seem a bit weird as the abstract state would then contain locations, which is implementation specific.

  Let the abstract state xs_v be a list of values. Then existentially quantify a list xs containing (loc * val * loc), whose value projection is xs_v: proj_val xs = xs_v

- Should I include all the small definitions like is_first, is_snd_last in the report?

- Formatting: format points to fraction? format persistent points to?

- In the proof outlines, should I refer to the rules I am using (wp-X, ht-Y, Inv-Alloc, etc)?
  Should I present it in the style of hoare triples, manipulating pre and post conditions?
  Or in the style of weakest precondition, matching the mechanised proofs?

- Should I use I or We in the report? 
  For instance: I open the invariant/We open the invariant.
  If I refer to something "I" in particular did, should I just refer to myself as I? E.g. I didn't realise this possibility in my first attempt.

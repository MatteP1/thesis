ANSWERED QUESTIONS

- What is the notation for agreement?
  ag (aginj in iris.sty)

- Why is the client not allowed to open the invariant associated with the Cnt/is_queue predicate?
  Answer: because I will have to use the view-shift while the invariant is open to prove the spec. This is only possible if the view-shift doesn't contain our invariant.


UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

- viewshift is defined as being persistent (ILN page 132). Isn't it then fine to have it outside the precondition?
  What is ==∗ actually?
  Iris doesn't recognise it as persistent, so not viewshift.

- When using hocap to derive sequential and concurrent specs, there are some name clashes: is_queue and Q_γ in particular. 
  Should I rename those in their own sections to avoid confusion?
  For example
  is_queue_seq and Q_γS
  is_queue_conc and Q_γC
  is_queue_hocap and Q_γH

- Should I use Namespaces everywhere instead of iname?
  Also on paper?

- How to derive Sequential and Concurrent specs in Coq?
  Should I just copy/past the initialise/enqueue/dequeue specs with a different is_queue predicate?

- Should derived specs be in hocap, their related specs, or their own separate file (i.e. TLMsqueueDerived.v)

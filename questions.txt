ANSWERED QUESTIONS

- What is the notation for agreement?
  ag (aginj in iris.sty)

- Why is the client not allowed to open the invariant associated with the Cnt/is_queue predicate?
  Answer: because I will have to use the view-shift while the invariant is open to prove the spec. This is only possible if the view-shift doesn't contain our invariant.


UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

- viewshift is defined as being persistent (ILN page 132). Isn't it then fine to have it outside the precondition?
  What is ==âˆ— actually?
  Iris doesn't recognise it as persistent, so not viewshift.

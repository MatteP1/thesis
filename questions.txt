- Should I include all the small definitions like is_first, is_snd_last in the report?
  Just explain them in a few sentences.

- Formatting: format points to fraction? format persistent points to? format list append (xs ++ xs').
  \mapsto^{\frac{1}{2}}. persisently: superscript. Just define own (experiment).

- In the proof outlines, should I refer to the rules I am using (wp-X, ht-Y, Inv-Alloc, etc)?
  Should I present it in the style of hoare triples, manipulating pre and post conditions?
  Or in the style of weakest precondition, matching the mechanised proofs?

  weakest-precondition style proofs are fine.
  have a section explaining some of the basic rules (hoare-triples, weakest-precondition, inv-alloc, resource algebra), and also iris in general.

- Should I use I or We in the report?
  For instance: I open the invariant/We open the invariant.
  If I refer to something "I" in particular did, should I just refer to myself as I? E.g. I didn't realise this possibility in my first attempt.
  Use we in general, but I for personal experiences.

- What is the notation for agreement?
  ag (aginj in iris.sty)

- Why is the client not allowed to open the invariant associated with the Cnt/is_queue predicate?
  Answer: because I will have to use the view-shift while the invariant is open to prove the spec. This is only possible if the view-shift doesn't contain our invariant.


- viewshift is defined as being persistent (ILN page 132). Isn't it then fine to have it outside the precondition?

- Should the list (xs) have the newest elements first and oldest last, or vice versa. Having newest first makes proofs easier as the queue only grows.
The other way is doable, but will require tedious induction proofs.

- I currently use a trick where I keep half of the tail pointer in order to match up previous elements from invariant with elements from later opens.
Is there a smarter way of doing this, or is this sufficient?

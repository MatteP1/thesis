- wp_cmpxchg_fail can't find persistent points-to predicates. What to do?
	Make it find it explicitly in the persistent context until bug has been fixed.

- Is there a nicer Induction hypothesis for enqueue (Löb)?

- I use the same resource algebra for the abstract state in two-lock and lock-free (queue_contents). Is there a way to handle them as one, or should I just define the RA twice?

- How to get spaces in notation. I.e. 
	Q_γ ⤇● xs_v instead of Q_γ⤇●xs_v.
	x ⤏ γ instead of x⤏γ
	x ⤳ y instead of x⤳y
	γ ↣ x instead of γ↣x

- Notation handles projections weirdly: γ_Tail Q_γ ↣ x_head instead of Q_γ.γ_Tail ↣ x_head instead of 

- Is it a fine way I handle the prophecy?

- How to make wp_pures not unfold n_in x_new (and similarly for n_out and n_val)?

- In dequeue, is there a way to handle both cases in unison, when we are in the inconsistent case? Both require reading head's next. One argues that head points persistently to a node, and the other non-persistently to None.

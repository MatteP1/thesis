- How should I structure my coq file (sequential and concurrent)?
  Also all of helper lemmas?
    yes. Split into separate files.

- Is it a normal way I have proved that isLL_chain persistent?
  Yes.

- Is sequential spec fine?
  Aren't the implementation details leaking out?
    Yes, this is fixed now.

- Do I have any bad practises in my proofs?
  Fixed

- What's next? Hocap? Lock-free?
  Hocap. Prepare some stuff for Wednesday

- For Hocap, would the concrete state be isLL xs, and the abstract state simply be xs?
  (See bottom of page 121 in https://iris-project.org/tutorial-pdfs/iris-lecture-notes.pdf)
  This would also seem a bit weird as the abstract state would then contain locations, which is implementation specific.

  Let the abstract state xs_val be a list of values. Then existentially quantify a list xs containing (loc * val * loc), whose value projection is xs_val: proj_val xs = xs_val
